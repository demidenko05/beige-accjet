<h3 align="center">Beigesoft™ Enterprise Information System Privacy Policy.</h3>
<h4 align="center">All Beigesoft™ EIS versions.</h4>
<p>  
  Beigesoft™ EIS collects (stores) your data only inside database file. Log files might contain private data.
</p>
<p>
  If you set option <b>Show debug messages</b> to <b>ON</b>,
  then log files <b>logStd0.log</b> and <b>logStd1.log</b> will contain private data.
  In that case, if you are going to send these log files to a programmer (who customize this application),
  then you hove to remove private data from these files.
</p>
<p>
  This is WEB-application, so you should use the newest version of WEB-browser. You should avoid to install any WEB-browser plugins.
</p>

<h4 align="center">Beigesoft™ EIS standalone versions.</h4>
<p>These versions are based on embedded private A-Jetty WEB-server.
  This private WEB-server is not available from outside your computer (or Android device).
  These versions require authorization with strong password (created by you). They allow maximum 6 fail login attempts.
  The session will be blocked in 15 minutes after 6th fail login attempts.
  You should periodically check file <b>logSec.log</b> that contains authorization information.
  These versions use modern encryption algorithms with strong keys for HTTPS connection and for safe encrypted file exchanging.
  These are multi-database versions, you can create new and switch the database from WEB-interface.
  If you a going to sent database file to another computer then you should use WEB-interface for encrypting this file.
</p>

<h4 align="center">Beigesoft™ EIS on embedded A-Jetty for ordinal computer.</h4>
<p>
  Your data is in database file, default is <b>webapp/bseis.sqlite</b>.
  You are able to copy (backup) database to a private place by using ordinal file manager.
  Keystore with secret keys for encryption is in <b>ks</b> folder. It is protected with strong password (created by you).
  You should set strong password for your OS account. It's advisable to set startup BIOS password on your computer. 
</p>

<h4 align="center">Beigesoft™ EIS on embedded A-Jetty for Android.</h4>
<p>
  Your data (SQLite databases), logStd.log, logSec.log, keystore (with secret keys) are in the private application storage.
  There is no way to read these files from there. Only this application can read and write these files.
  You can lost your data if you forget password (for keystore or/and application),
  so you should backup database files by using WEB-interface.
  This requires Beige-EIS standalone version on another computer (or Android device),
  cause application encrypts files with public key that belong to another Beige-EIS.
  Only another Beige-EIS (whose public key used for encryption) can decrypts these encrypted files.
  PDF reports will be downloaded into shared storage (external, USB, CD-card),
  so avoid to install any unnecessary application that requires permission to this storage.
  In the next year all Android applications can access any file on shared storage only when user allows it interactively, that is user will be asked about opening a file,
  so there will be no way of hidden reads of your files on shared storage. But if you connect your Android device to a computer in file transfer mode,
  then any application on that computer can read your files directly (in hidden way).
</p>

<h4 align="center">Beigesoft™ EIS cloud version.</h4>
<p>
  Cloud (Internet available) version is more difficult to keep your data private, so use it only when it's necessary.
  You must yourself handle strong passwords and reliable HTTPS connection.
